      A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone,
      and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the
      bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in
      the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
      I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment;
      and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.
